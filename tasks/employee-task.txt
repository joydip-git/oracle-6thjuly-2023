create an application to create multiple instances of employee and calculate their salary

1. create an employee class in a separate package with following 
	state: name, id, basicpay, dapay, hrapay
	behavior: a method to calculate salary which accepts no argument and returns the calculated total salary (ex. calculateSalary)
	**: class should have getters and setters for all the data members

2. create another class with main method in separate package
	a. ask users, how many employee records to create
	b. create that many employee objects (accept input from user about employee data)
	c. create an array to store those employee objects
	d. now, iterate through the array and pick up one employee object at a time and then calculate the salary of that employee and print the salary
